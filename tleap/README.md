# Overview 

A collection of tLeAp scripts used to generate topology and coordinate files for the DNA models.

# Scripts

* `commands.tleap`: Loads all files (including `leaprc.q4mdfft`) and creates topology and coordinate files of the DNA models.
* `leaprc.q4mdfft`: Loads non-standard residue force field files. This is a file generated by <cite>[PyRED][1]</cite> which I modified.
