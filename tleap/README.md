# Overview 

A collection of tLEaP scripts used to generate topology and coordinate files for the DNA models.

# Scripts

* `commands.tleap`: Loads all necessary files (including `leaprc.q4mdfft`) and creates topology and coordinate files of the DNA models.
* `leaprc.q4mdfft`: Loads non-standard residue force field files. This is a file initially generated by the <cite>[PyRED program][1]</cite>, then modified by me.

# Directories

* `FF_files`: Force field files of the non-standard internal nucleotide fragments generated by the <cite>[PyRED program available in R.E.D. Server][1]</cite>. These are only used for Parmbsc1-based simulations.
* `input_pdbs`: PDB files initially generated by BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2024, then modified by me (i.e. remove the non-bridging oxygens and change the residue names of the nucleotides that will be replaced with their charge-neutral modifications), which are loaded into tLeAp.
