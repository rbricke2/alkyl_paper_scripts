# Force field files

* `CT-A_m1-c1_m2-c1.mol2`: Force field file of a central thymine fragment containing a decyl-phosphate group. The modification is located on the non-bridging oxygen atom `OP2`.
* `CT-A_m1-c1_m4-c1.mol2`: Force field file of a central cytosine fragment containing a decyl-phosphate group. The modification is located on the non-bridging oxygen atom `OP2`.
* `CT-A_m3-c1_m2-c1.mol2`: Force field file of a central thymine fragment containing an ethyl-phosphate group. The modification is located on the non-bridging oxygen atom `OP2`.
* `CT-A_m3-c1_m4-c1.mol2`: Force field file of a central cytosine fragment containing an ethyl-phosphate group. The modification is located on the non-bridging oxygen atom `OP2`.
* `CT-A_m5-c1_m2-c1.mol2`: Force field file of a central thymine fragment containing an ethyl-phosphate group. The modification is located on the non-bridging oxygen atom `OP1`.
