def moving_average(data, max_window_size):
    """
        The moving average is calculated with a varying window size to:
            (i)  force the initial data point to be plotted (the initial configuration of all DNA
                 models are generated from the same structure, meaning that all DNAs initially
                 have a similar value, e.g. radius of gyration value, in the original series...
                 we want this to be shown in our plots); and
            (ii) keep the size of the output series the same as the original series.
        
        In the first iteration, the window size = 1.
        In each following iteration, the window size will increase by two (i.e. increase the number of
        elements we take from both the left and the right of the i-th element by one) until the window
        size = max_window_size.
        When we approach the rightmost boundary of the original data series and the window size can no
        longer equal max_window_size, we decrease the window size by one (i.e. decrease the number of
        elements we take from the right by one) each iteration.

        Parameters:
            data            (list[int or float]) : data points to compute moving average from
            max_window_size (int)                : the maximum size of the window, i.e., the 
                                                   maximum number of data points used to calculate
                                                   the moving average

        Returns:
            moving_averages (list[float])        : series of averages of data (same size as the input
                                                   series)
